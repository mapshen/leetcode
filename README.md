# How to Get Started

Your own branch is already created, named `member/<your-name>`. 

Please fork **this** repo, and, in your **forked** repo, create a branch with the name of `<week-number>/<topic-name>` for each week's assignment. For example, your week 2 branch should be called `week2/solutions`.

You will mainly work off the `<week-number>/solutions` branch in your **forked** repo.

When you finish the assignment, open up a pull request to merge it to the `member/<your-name>` branch in **this** primary repo.

Each pull request requires at least 2 approvals.

Topics are listed as below:

* Week 1: binary-search
* Week 2: breadth-first-search
* Week 3: depth-first-search 
* Week 4: back-tracking 
* Week 5: divide-and-conquer 
* Week 6: dynamic-programming 
* Week 7: topological-sort 
* Week 8: bit-manipulation 

# How to Contribute

You need to update the `README.md`, which contains problems others need to solve, of your chosen topic prior to our weekly disccusion.

Similarly, you will prepare the problem set on a branch (can be named like `<week-number>/problem-set`) in your **forked** repo and request to merge it into **this** repo's master branch when you are ready.
